for tests run:

npm test mandelbrot.test.js

Input
Each test case is described by a single line containing three numbers: two real numbers −3 ≤ x ≤ 3 and −3 ≤ y ≤ 3, and an integer 0 ≤ r ≤ 10,000. The value of c for this case is x + yi, and r is the maximum number of iterations to compute.

Output
For each case, display the case number followed by whether the given c is in the Mandelbrot set, using IN or OUT.
