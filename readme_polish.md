for tests run:

rspec polish_spec.rb

Input
Each test case is described by a single line containing an expression. The expression is a sequence of space-separated tokens (integers, operators, and single-character lowercase variables). Each expression will be correctly formatted in Polish notation, with at most 2048 symbols (operators and operators combined). Integer constants will be in the range [âˆ’10, 10].

Output
For each case, display the case number followed by the simplified expression in Polish notation, in the same format as the input. Do not modify the expression other than the simplification step described earlier. All intermediate computations will fit within a signed 32-bit integer. Follow the format of the sample output.
